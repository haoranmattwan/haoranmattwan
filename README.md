### Summary

I am a quantitative researcher and a Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis (exp. May 2026), specializing in applying advanced computational and statistical models to understand complex human behavior. My expertise lies in **Bayesian hierarchical modeling**, **experimental design**, and building end-to-end **reproducible data analysis pipelines** in both the R and Python ecosystems.

---

### Core Competencies

* **Languages & Ecosystems**: R (`tidyverse`, `brms`, `cmdstanr`, `lme4`), Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `pymc`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`)
* **Modeling & Inference**: Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling, Generalized Linear Models, Nonlinear Modeling, Causal Inference, Longitudinal Data Analysis, Multivariate Analysis
* **Tools & Platforms**: Stan, Git/GitHub/GitLab, Stata

### Portfolio: Reproducible Analyses of Peer-Reviewed Research

This portfolio showcases my commitment to reproducible science and technical versatility by providing end-to-end analyses for my peer-reviewed publications in both **R** and **Python**. Each project includes a complete replication of the original analysis, demonstrating proficiency across different modeling frameworks and libraries.
